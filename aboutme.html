        <p class="about-me-title">About me</p>
        <p class="about-me">Hello, I'm Sulaiman Mukhtar, a dedicated <strong>.NET Developer</strong> with a passion for
            creating and
            bringing ideas to life. Building things has always fascinated me, and I find immense joy in transforming
            concepts into tangible realities. Through my journey in programming and graphic design, I've discovered the
            power of turning imagination into meaningful outcomes.<br /><br />
            My programming journey began in 2019 when I immersed myself in the world of <strong>C#</strong>. As I delved
            into the
            language's syntax, I embarked on an exciting adventure with <strong>Xamarin Forms</strong>, crafting
            intuitive applications
            along the way. While some of my personal projects remain ongoing, I recently achieved a significant
            milestone with the release of <em>'Budget'</em>, an app designed to empower users in effectively managing
            their
            finances. Currently, I'm focused on bringing even more exciting projects to completion.<br /><br />
            Exploring the realm of Xamarin Forms, I found myself captivated by graphics design. Driven by my love for
            video games, I eagerly dived into creating captivating branding materials, including logos, flyers, and
            mesmerizing character designs. This journey kindled my passion for game development, leading me to the
            remarkable world of <strong>Unity</strong>. With Unity, I honed my skills and broadened my horizons as a
            game
            developer.<br /><br />
            Driven by a deep curiosity, I expanded my expertise into <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>, fascinated by the
            vast potential of
            the web. My focus shifted towards leveraging APIs to unlock new possibilities in web development. This
            journey has brought me to where I stand today, constantly pushing boundaries and seeking innovative
            solutions.<br /><br />
            I firmly believe in the importance of embracing unwavering innovation and continuously refining my skills.
            Recognizing the power of effective problem-solving techniques, I strive to approach challenges with a
            creative and proactive mindset.</p>
