            <p class="privacy-statement">
                At Budjet, we are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection
                laws.
                This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our app.
                By
                using Budjet, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.<br /><br />
                1.<strong>Collection of App Event Data</strong>:
                We collect anonymized app event data, such as navigations and button clicks, to improve the app's
                functionality and enhance user experience. This data is collected using Google Analytics and utilizes
                the
                Advertising ID provided by your device for user identification purposes.<br /><br />
                2. <strong>Transaction Data</strong>:
                We collect and transmit the title, amount, type, category, and date of transactions to Google Analytics.
                This information helps us analyze user behavior and improve our services.<br /><br />
                3. <strong>Theme Changes and Button Clicks</strong>:
                We collect data on theme changes, home button clicks, template deletions, and currency changes to
                enhance
                the app's usability and provide a personalized experience. This data is shared using Firebase
                Analytics.<br /><br />
                4. <strong>Data Sharing</strong>:
                We only share your data with Google Analytics for the purpose of app analytics and usage tracking. We do
                not
                disclose your information to any third parties.<br /><br />
                5. <strong>Deletion of Transactions</strong>:
                Please note that when you delete a transaction on your device, it may not be immediately removed from
                Google
                Analytics. However, we take appropriate measures to protect your privacy and secure your
                information.<br /><br />
                6. <strong>Data Usage</strong>:
                The data we collect is used solely for internal purposes, such as app usage analysis, improving our
                services, and enhancing user experience.<br /><br />
                7. <strong>Data Security</strong>:
                We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or
                alteration. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
                Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute data security.<br /><br />
                8. <strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong>:
                We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal
                requests.<br /><br />
                9. <strong>Children's Privacy</strong>:
                Budjet is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
                information from children. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a child,
                please contact us immediately.<br /><br />
                10. <strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong>:
                We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy as necessary. We will notify you of any
                significant changes through the app or other means.<br /><br />
