        <p class="privacy-statement">
            This Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines how FlapMaster ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and
            protects your information when you use our mobile game application ("App"). Please read this Policy
            carefully to understand how we handle your data. By downloading, installing, and using the FlapMaster App,
            you agree to the practices described in this Policy.<br /><br />

            <strong>Information We Collect</strong><br /><br />

            We do not collect any personal information or data from users of the FlapMaster App. The game can be played
            offline, and we do not gather any information about your gameplay, interactions, or device.<br /><br />

            <strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br /><br />

            Since we do not collect any information from users, we do not use any data for any purpose.<br /><br />

            <strong>Data Storage and Security</strong><br /><br />

            The FlapMaster game settings are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to or store any
            personal information on our servers. We take reasonable measures to secure the game settings within the App
            to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure.<br /><br />

            <strong>Data Deletion</strong><br /><br />

            If you choose to clear data or uninstall the App, all stored game settings will be permanently deleted from
            your device.<br /><br />

            <strong>Third-Party Links and Services</strong><br /><br />

            The FlapMaster App does not contain any links to third-party websites or services. This Privacy Policy
            applies only to our game and does not extend to any external links or services that may be referenced within
            the App.<br /><br />

            <strong>Children's Privacy</strong><br /><br />

            The FlapMaster App is suitable for users of all ages. We do not collect any personal information from
            children. Parents or guardians who believe that their child has provided personal information to us without
            their consent can contact us, and we will promptly take steps to delete such information.<br /><br />

            <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br /><br />

            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other
            operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates to this Policy will be reflected in the App's
            description on the respective app store platforms.<br /><br />

            <strong>Contact Us</strong><br /><br />

            If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the FlapMaster App, please contact me at
            <a href="mailto:sulaymahn28@gmail.com"

            Privacy Policy. Thank you for playing FlapMaster!
